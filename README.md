# Microfronted

This is a repo, which uses the microfrontend architecture for building web apps, it uses React as well as Vue ( although i don't know vue.js, i'm using it just for the purpose of testing running several framework in one app )

- The features ( login , signup ) are not functional , just a placeholder
